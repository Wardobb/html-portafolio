<h1>The Best Movies According to Abraham</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Movie: Mugen Train</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorites because in just one hour, 
you fall in love with a character who only has that little screen time throughout the entire series. 
The character conveys their feelings to you and has their life goal very clearly defined.</p>
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite classics, and it's very simpleâ€”no one can hate Forrest Gump.</p>
<h3>Star Wars: Episode III</h3>
<p>Simply watching how Anakin is corrupted to become Darth Vader is impressive. 
It's always good to go back to the past and watch these movies that we liked so much in their day</p>
